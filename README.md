# ASM Swift

Learning assembly is hard for newcomers, mostly because the documentation is a little harder to read, and there's so much of it. It's too easy to get overwhelmed by information.

This project aims to make it easier for someone to learn to "think in assembly" by providing a (much nicer) development environment to practice in that still *feels* like an assembly environment. In the long term, I'd like to have a suite of programming challenges (with solutions). This project is modeled after x86 Assembly. Feel free to submit your own in a PR.


## I want to learn!

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ThePantsThief/ASM-Swift/wiki) for documentation and example code.

## I want to help!

PRs welcome! Just please stick to my code style. I'm trying to make this in the image of x86 assembly with few exceptions, since that's what I know best.

Feature requests and suggestions are also welcome. And check out the [Projects tab](https://github.com/ThePantsThief/ASM-Swift/projects) for a list of missing features if you want something to work on.

At the moment, I haven't properly documented all functions/instructions. I'd love some PRs correcting [documentation markup](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/).

If you find a **bug**, please open an issue. If you fix it, submit a PR as well.
